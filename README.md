# Statistical-Analysis - VHDL


# Summary:
Our VHDL project aims to develop a system capable of receiving data blocks through serial communication and conducting comprehensive statistical analysis, encompassing calculations for maximum, minimum, average, and median values. Additionally, the system will be equipped to detect and quantify errors occurring during the communication process for each received data block. Leveraging pre-existing component files, we will seamlessly integrate essential functionalities to support the implementation.
